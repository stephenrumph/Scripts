# 🛠️ Security Utilities

## 📌 Overview

I have begun the task of creating some helpful utilities for pen testing and ethical hacking. They are mostly built off the back of existing open source tools. While these tools may be helpful for others they are really for me to sharpen my scripting skills and use in my own capacity. If they don't work for you, edit them and make them your own. They are purley for educational purposes. 

## 🚀 Why I'm Making These Tools

I've built these tools to:

- Automate repetitive or boring tasks
- Learn and reinforce coding and security concepts
- Share solutions with the community
- Build a portfolio of practical and open-source work

Everything here is created with purpose and usually born from a problem I’ve run into in the real world — either in study, CTFs, or on the job.

## 🧰 Tools Included

| Tool Name       | Description                                             | Status     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `ad-bloodhound-pyjson.sh`  | A script to help me with remembering the syntax for AD enumeration for use in bloodhound | ✅ Working |
| `simple-http-form-brute.sh`   | Automates remembering the syntax of hydra for bruteforcing simple http web forms   | ✅ Working   |

More tools will be added as I build them.
